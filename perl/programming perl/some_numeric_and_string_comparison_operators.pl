## comparison operators

# Equal                 ==      eq      True if $a is equal to $b
# Not equal             !=      ne      True if $a is not equal to $b
# Less than             <       lt      True if $a is less than $b
# Greater than          >       gt      True if $a is greater than $b
# Less than or equal    <=      le      True if $a not greater than $b
# Greater than or equal >=      ge      True if $a not less than $b
# Comparison            <=>     cmp     0 if equal, 1 if $a greater, âˆ’1 if $b greater
# the last pair of operators (<=>)
#   are entirely redundant with the earilier operators
#   however, they're incredibly useful in sort subroutines
