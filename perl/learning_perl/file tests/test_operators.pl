checking whether a file is being kept up-to-date

remove a large file to a backup when it hasn't been accessed in the last 90 days
the -s file test operator return the file size in bytes

the -r -s test a list of filenames to see which ones are readable
-t is exception, because that is only use in TTY (by default, it test STDIN)
=cut

=pod
when the perl parser sees the slash after -s operator, it will looking for the optional operand for -s (just like a filename in regular expression), rather than a division
=cut

# The filename is in $_
my $size_in_K = -s / 1024;  # Oops!

my $size_in_k = (-s $filename) / 1024;  # uses $_ by default

# of course, it's always safe to explicitly give a file test a parameter
my $size_in-k = (-s $filename) / 1024;
