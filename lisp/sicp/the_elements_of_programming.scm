;;; describle a language

;; when we describle a language
;; we should pay particular attention to the means that
;;   the language provides for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas
;; every powerful language has three mechanism for accomplishing this
;; primitive expressions
;;   which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with
;; means of combination
;;   by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and
;; means of abstraction
;;   by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units

;;; procedures and data

;; in programming, we deal with two kinds of elements
;;   procedures and data
;; informally
;;   data is "stuff" that we want to manipulate
;;   and procedures are descriptions of the rules for manipulate the data
;; thus, any powerful programming language should be able to describle
;;   primitive data and primitive procedures and
;;   have methods for combining and abstracting procedures and data

;; in this chapter we will deal only with simple numerical data
;;   so that we can focus on the rules for building procedures
