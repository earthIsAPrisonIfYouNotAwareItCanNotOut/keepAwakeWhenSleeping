;;; the act of mind

;; the acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas
;;   are chiefly these three:
;; 1. combining several simple ideas into one compoind one
;;    and thus all complex ideas are made
;; 2. the second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together
;;    and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once
;;    without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations
;; 3. the third is separating them from all other ideas that
;;      accompany them in their real existence
;; this is called abstraction
;;   and thus all its general ideas are made

;;; well-designed computational systems

;; it likes well-designed automobiles or nuclear reactors
;;   are designed in a modular manner
;;   so that the parts can be constructed, replaced and debugged separately
